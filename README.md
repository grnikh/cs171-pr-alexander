Alexander - A CS171 Final
=========================

This project, Alexander and the Gymnosophist - 60 Years of Peace, integrates different kinds of data about military conflicts since the end of World War II to communicate the price that humanity pays for warfare.. It was created by [Raahil Sha](mailto:raahilsha@college.harvard.edu) and [Grigory Khimulya](mailto:khimulya@college.harvard.edu) as a final project for Spring Semester 2015 of CS171.

Most of the features of our website are completely self-explanatory, or are explained in our screencast video. Other explanations are offered in text on our site.
Nonetheless, here are controls for you to note:

* Click on green buttons with downward pointing arrows to progress
* Move sliders to select years. The pictogram at the end requires you to select a start and an end using sliders.
* Click on green play buttons to watch history year by year.
* Hover of pretty much anything (except the pictogram) for more information
